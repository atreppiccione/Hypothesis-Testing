# Hypothesis-Testing
This project aims to test if University towns in the US have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions.

The following 3 files are used: 
1) City_Zhvi_AllHomes.csv (housing data for the United States)
2) university_towns.txt (list of University towns in the US) 
3) gdplev.xls (GDP over time of the US in current dollars)
